# Neural Language Models


This repository contains neural language model implementations trained and tested on Penn Treebank.

1. **Multi-layer LSTM with Dropout**: The link to the notebook is [here](https://github.com/pranav-ust/nlm/blob/master/LSTM%20Language%20Model.ipynb). It receives perplexity around 175.6
2. **Gated Convolutional Networks with Residual Connections**: The link to the notebook is [here](https://github.com/pranav-ust/nlm/blob/master/Gated%20Convolutional%20Networks.ipynb). It receives perplexity around 105.03
